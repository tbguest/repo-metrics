# Repo Metrics

## Compare repositories by interest and development effort metrics

This is a for-fun project built with Next.js and TypeScript, using:

- `useSWR` hook for client-side data fetching and managing server state
- MongoDB and Next-Auth for optional persistence of users' repo selections
- Chart.js for data visualizations
- Tailwind for styling (in progress)
